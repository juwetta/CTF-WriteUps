# CTF-WriteUps

This is a hard categary web challenge from FSIIECTF.

Should be a unique challenge, as it is closer to a programming challenge, rather than a web exploitation challenge...

Brief description: We need to answer 300 questions in order to get the flag. 
Every question will generate a bunch of point pairs. eg. (x1, y1), (x2, y2)

So, we need to check if all the point pairs is a single line. 
If its a sinlge line, answer 'yes', else 'no'.

So to get the flag, we made a python script...
